# rev

**rev** (formerly MyReview) is a local GitHub pull-request review app, built on [Glassbox](https://github.com/brianwestphal/glassbox). Keep several PRs open, read full-file unified diffs, navigate with the keyboard, and post comments to GitHub without leaving the app.

The `main` branch contains the current personal app, including its Git-graph icon. Legacy `glassbox` commands and data directories remain compatible. This fork is not the upstream `glassbox` npm package.

## Install from source

Clone and install the macOS desktop app:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mcharrel/rev.git && ./rev/install.sh --desktop
```

The script installs dependencies, builds rev into `~/Applications/rev.app`, sets up `~/.local/bin/rev`, and guides you through GitHub sign-in if needed. It adds the command directory to your Bash/Zsh configuration. No `sudo` or global npm installation is needed. On Linux, or for a browser-only installation, omit `--desktop`.

You need Git to clone the repository. On macOS, the script uses an existing [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installation to install missing Node.js/npm and GitHub CLI dependencies. On Linux, or without Homebrew, install Node.js 22.12+, npm and [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) first; the installer checks these before building.

Start rev from a new terminal with `rev`, or run `~/.local/bin/rev` immediately. This starts the local app in your browser at `http://localhost:4183`. Use `rev serve --no-open` to run without opening a browser. The server binds only to your computer.

Keep the cloned directory: the command runs the build from that checkout. Rerunning the installer rebuilds it without changing review data or GitHub credentials. It refuses to overwrite an unrelated existing `rev` launcher; use `--bin-dir /another/directory` if needed. Run `./rev/install.sh --help` for the options, including `--no-auth` and `--no-path` for unattended installs.

Open a PR from another terminal or paste its URL into the app's **+** tab:

```sh
rev open https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY/pull/123
```

Trailing GitHub URL fragments and query parameters are accepted. Opening a PR reuses the running app; source downloads and GitHub metadata load in the background. Review state and the comment outbox persist locally.

### macOS desktop details

The desktop build requires Xcode Command Line Tools; the script installs missing Rust through Homebrew when available. The first native build takes longer. Quit an existing rev desktop app before replacing it. `--app-dir /another/directory` changes the destination.

The native bundle includes Node and uses local ad-hoc signing, so no release signing keys are required. Upstream automatic updates are disabled for this source build; rerun the installer to update. The `rev` command continues to provide the standalone browser workspace; legacy native `glassbox` launchers remain available in the app bundle.

### GitHub accounts

rev uses `gh` credentials; never put tokens in this repository. For multiple accounts, create `~/.glassbox/workspace-config.json` locally:

```json
{
  "accounts": {
    "OWNER/REPOSITORY": "your-github-login"
  },
  "repositories": {
    "OWNER/REPOSITORY": "/path/to/your/local/checkout"
  }
}
```

Existing local checkouts can speed up first imports. Every open PR tab refreshes GitHub status, reviewers, CI checks, description and comments in the background every five minutes. **Cmd/Ctrl+R** refreshes immediately and loads new source revisions; background refresh keeps the code snapshot stable while you read. Main-view comments publish to GitHub on every PR. Code comments on your own PRs stay local; code comments on other people’s PRs publish to GitHub. Offline writes retry every five minutes. Disposable managed checkouts expire after two weeks without use or updates, with unpublished work preserved.

### Deployment status

Merged PRs show deployment status grouped by service instead of CI checks. Each service lists staging datacenters first, then production, then federal (including federal staging); unclassified datacenters follow. Fully reached datacenters come first within each tier. Partial, deploying, missing and unknown states are distinct; hover over a row for environment and namespace details. Status refreshes every five minutes and with Cmd/Ctrl+R, without blocking the review.

Settings → **My company → Deployments** selects a local shell command or an HTTP GET endpoint and an explicit list of GitHub organizations. Tracking is disabled by default. Saving settings cancels old requests, clears old deployment results and refreshes matching merged tabs without blocking the settings dialog. Commands, endpoints and optional Authorization headers live only in the user's global config (`~/.glassbox/config.json`, mode 0600), never in project settings, review exports or the public repository. No company-specific provider configuration ships with the app.

For a command, print a text/Markdown deployment report to stdout. PR values are supplied as environment variables: `REV_PR_URL`, `REV_PR_OWNER`, `REV_PR_REPO`, `REV_PR_NUMBER`; `REV_SERVICES` contains suggested services separated by newlines (empty on the initial request). Quote variables in your command. The command runs from the local configuration directory with your environment; its output is never treated as shell code.

For an endpoint, use an HTTPS URL (HTTP is supported for localhost). URL-encoded placeholders are `{pr_url}`, `{owner}`, `{repo}`, `{number}`, and `{services}` (a JSON array). An optional Authorization header is stored locally. Redirects are not followed. For example: `https://deployments.example/status?pr={pr_url}&services={services}`.

Both sources accept service headings followed by a table:

```text
**example-service**
| Datacenter | Env | Namespace | Deployed |
| east.example | staging | app | (deployed) |
| west.example | prod | app | (ongoing) |
```

Statuses are `(deployed)`, `(ongoing)`, `(missing)`, or unknown. A service heading followed by `Not found` represents an empty result. If the source returns `Changed services found: ` followed by backtick-quoted service names (or `Here is the list of all impacted services detected:` followed by `- name` lines), rev retries once with those services. Each request has a 90-second timeout and a 1 MiB output limit. Source errors are shown without recording raw output or private connection details.

### GUIDE and LEARN

Choose a provider and model in Settings to generate review guidance. API keys belong in local settings or the OS keychain, never in Git. GUIDE and LEARN follow the visible code. Press **a**, then **i** to replace guidance with a fresh review (at most once per five minutes per PR).

## Codex workflow

After creating a draft PR, run this **inside the Codex chat that created it**:

```sh
rev open https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY/pull/123
```

Codex supplies `CODEX_THREAD_ID`, so rev links your own PR to that original chat once ownership is known. Other people’s PRs are opened without a Codex binding. Opening it from a normal terminal still works, without linking a chat. An existing link cannot silently be replaced by another chat. Add the command to your personal agent instructions to make draft-PR opening automatic.

**Main-view comments publish to GitHub on every PR**, including your own, and never go to Codex. Their edits and deletes sync with GitHub too. On **your own PRs**, comments on code, their follow-ups, edits, deletes, and Codex replies stay **local to rev**. Linked comments are saved as `new comment: …`, with the PR URL and source location. Ordinary comments use the original chat's queue; a leading `[steer]` requests immediate steering of its active turn. On **other people’s PRs**, your code comments also publish to **GitHub only**, without Codex watching or answering them. Code comments wait until ownership is known; Main-view comments only need GitHub authentication. A private comment can never become public through a refresh, retry, or account change. Imported GitHub comments and old annotations do not trigger Codex; existing published comments remain on GitHub. rev never starts a separate comment agent.

**Current limitation:** delivery requires a Codex installation whose desktop chat is connected to an existing shared app server exposing `thread/queue/add`, `thread/queue/start`, and `turn/steer`. A desktop session running its private stdio server cannot receive these messages from rev. Linking/opening still works, but comments stay visibly pending. This is not a substitute for the originating chat, and rev never resumes a second process against the same history.

Only for a compatible shared-server setup, launch rev with `REV_CODEX_SHARED_SERVER=1` and have the desktop use that same server. It performs a WebSocket handshake on `$CODEX_HOME/app-server-control/app-server-control.sock` (default `~/.codex`); set `REV_CODEX_SOCKET` for a custom Unix socket. It does not spawn a CLI, start a daemon, or expose a network port. The chat's existing model and permissions remain in effect. If delivery is interrupted, rev asks you to check the chat before resending to avoid duplicate work.

Local code comments have a thin status band inside a neutral card:

- Gray (`#656C76`): pending pickup. Delivery to the chat alone does not change this.
- Yellow (`#D29922`): the agent acknowledged pickup and is working.
- Green (`#00B401`): the agent posted an answer into the comment thread.

The originating agent uses these commands, with `CODEX_THREAD_ID` unchanged:

```sh
# Read outstanding requests, including their IDs, revisions and source context.
rev comments https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY/pull/123
# Acknowledge the returned revision before starting work.
rev pickup https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY/pull/123 --comment COMMENT_ID --revision 1
# Post the answer and mark that request answered in one operation.
rev reply https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY/pull/123 --comment COMMENT_ID --revision 1 --body-file reply.txt
```

Posted comments are read-only; use a follow-up to clarify. A new agent reply checks for pushed commits. Rev refreshes the code while you are away from it, or shows an orange **Refresh** button while you are reading. Click it or press Cmd/Ctrl+R to refresh immediately. Unfinished code-comment drafts defer automatic refresh.

Incoming messages include these instructions. Pickup and reply are idempotent, restricted to the bound chat, and work even when incoming push delivery is unavailable. Revision checks still reject stale pickup/reply attempts for historical requests. A follow-up is a separate request with its own status. Already-posted answers remain visible. Replies appear as **Codex** below the original comment and stay local to rev. Add this workflow to the originating agent's instructions; no separate chat or model is started.

Panel sizes and per-PR reading positions are remembered. Source files come first, followed by YAML, tests, dependencies, and generated protos. [MY_GLASSBOX.md](MY_GLASSBOX.md) records the full customization history.

## Update and develop

```sh
cd rev
git pull --ff-only && ./install.sh --desktop
```

Omit `--desktop` for a browser-only installation. Restart the app after updating. To incorporate upstream changes, fetch the original project into an `upstream` remote and merge on a separate branch before updating `main`; personal changes do not prevent future upstream updates.

Run `npm test -- --maxWorkers=4`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run typecheck` before publishing changes. Never commit `.env`, review databases, local workspace mappings, Codex connection files, API tokens, or private PR content. The inherited Glassbox architecture documentation remains under [docs/](docs/).
